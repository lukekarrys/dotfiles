# Luke's dotfiles

You probably don't want to use these. They're messy and I change them all the time.

If you see anything you like, feel free to grab it :) Or if you have questions, open an issue.

## After making changes

```sh
./bootstrap.sh
dotdone
```

## Installation on a new machine

See [setup](./SETUP.md).

Thanks to [Mathias Bynens' dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). This started as a fork of those amazing dotfiles and then grew into the weird abomination they are now.
