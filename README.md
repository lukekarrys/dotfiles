# Luke's dotfiles

You probably don't want to use them. I mess with from time to time to fit my needs.

## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

```shell
curl -L https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh
git clone git@github.com:powerline/fonts.git # and install
./bootstrap.sh
# use _config/ files for iterm/sublime
```

## Thanks toâ€¦

[Mathias Bynens](http://mathiasbynens.be/) for his [dotfiles]((https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). These are basically those with some stuff deleted and modified to work with `zsh` to fit my needs.
