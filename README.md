# Luke's dotfiles

You probably don't want to use these. They're messy and I change them all the time.

If you see anything you like, feel free to grab it :) Or if you have questions, open an issue.

## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

```shell
curl -L https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh
git clone git@github.com:powerline/fonts.git # and install
./bootstrap.sh
```

```shell
brew bundle ~/.Brewfile
```

Thanks to [Mathias Bynens' dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). This started as a fork of those amazing dotfiles and then grew into the weird abomination they are now.
