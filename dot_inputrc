# Make Tab autocomplete regardless of filename case
set completion-ignore-case on

# List all matches in case multiple possible completions are possible
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# This line sets the completions to be listed immediately instead of ringing the
# bell, when the completing word has more than one possible completion but no
# partial completion can be made.
set show-all-if-unmodified on

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Do not autocomplete hidden files unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files off

# Show all autocomplete results at once
set page-completions off

# If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 200

# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on

#  This line sets 3 to be the maximum number of characters to be the common
#  prefix to display for completions. If the common prefix has more than 3
#  characters, they are replaced by ellipsis. For example, assume we are in a
#  directory with files Screenshot_20170730.png and Screenshot_20170731.png. If
#  using the default option, an auto completion prints Screenshot_20170730.png
#  Screenshot_20170731.png. If this option is set, then the auto completion
#  prints ...0.png ...1.png. However, if the common prefix is very short (fewer
#  or equal to 3 characters), the full file names are still printed. For
#  example, in a directory with files S10.png and S11.png, an auto completion
#  still prints S10.png S11.png. This can be very useful when auto completing in
#  a directory in which a lot of files have a long common prefix, such a camera
#  image directory.
set completion-prefix-display-length 3

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'
